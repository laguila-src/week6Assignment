// Week 6 Coding Assignment- War! An Automated Card Game
//
// Requirements:
// ‚Ä¢	Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
// ‚Ä¢	Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
// ‚Ä¢	The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
// ‚Ä¢    Ties result in zero points for both Players
// ‚Ä¢	After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
// ‚Ä¢	Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.


// Cards have suits, ranks and values, ex:
// A queen of hearts:
//          suit- hearts, rank- queen, value- 12

// console.log(sampleCard);
